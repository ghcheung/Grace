  <p>It is light blue. It is 3 years old. It came from the Virginia Tech bookstore.</p>

  <h3>About the Hydroflask</h3>
  <p>Big enough for all-day hydration and easy sipping, our 32 oz Wide Mouth Bottle with Straw Lid is made with professional-grade stainless steel and a wider opening for faster fill. And our Color Last™ powder coat is dishwasher safe for even more convenience. Cold stays ice cold for 24 hours, and hot stays wickedly hot for 12 — just like always.</p>
